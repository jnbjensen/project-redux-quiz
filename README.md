# Redux quiz group project
This quiz features five multiple-choice questions, a progress counter and a summary page at the end, all of which are built around Redux state management.

## The problem
This was a group project that entailed a great deal of mob programming and individual trouble-shooting. We used React hooks, props and styled components along with Redux state management to build the quiz.
If we had more time, we could have included a breakdown of the user's answers to each question when they reach the end screen.
